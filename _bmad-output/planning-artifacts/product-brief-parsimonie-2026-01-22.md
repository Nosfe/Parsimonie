## Vision Discovery Notes (In Progress)

### User Vision Statement (Raw Input)

> "I have not encountered any of those issues or pain points I just want to build a good/nice to use/useful website for my guild, I can handle the guild without it but I want to aggregate everything in one place in order for it to be more practical and more customizable"

> "Success would be if everyone on the guild would stop to go on several website and go on the parsimonie website for like 80% of their needs in wow, I would want them to say that this website saves them the trouble of looking into humongous database be it from wowhead or warcraft logs BUT without missing ANY data at all, plus a nice UX UI"

> "The automated theorycrafted loot suggestion/target list for each tier available depending on everyone current gear"

### Key Insights Captured

**Motivation:** Convenience & Delight (not problem-solving)

**Core Vision:** Aggregation + Curation + UX
- One destination for 80% of guild WoW needs
- All the data from multiple sources, none of the noise
- Beautiful, personalized UX
- Customizable to guild preferences

**Signature Feature:** Automated BiS/Loot Targeting
- Per-tier loot suggestions
- Based on each player's current gear
- Theorycrafted recommendations

**Success Metric:** "This website saves me the trouble of looking into humongous databases"

### Pending Questions (Resume Here)

1. **Wowhead frustrations** - What specifically is noisy? Ads? Irrelevant content? TBC-specific findability?

2. **WarcraftLogs accessibility** - How to make parse/log data more accessible for raiders?

3. **Loot Targeting approach:**
   - Use existing BiS lists (class Discord/guides) as source? OR
   - Calculate BiS dynamically (more complex)?
   - Account for loot system queue (who else wants it)?

4. **The other 20%** - What would Parsimonie NOT handle? (Scope definition)
